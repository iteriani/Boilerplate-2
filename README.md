Design Principles used
- Affordance: Text box at the top is clearly a search box, because there is a “Search” button.
- Visibility: Can see the state of posts containing the given word, in the form of popularity and frequency of use. It’s also intuitive that it can be clicked for more information. We also included instructions at the top of the page in case of any confusion.
- Feedback: Results are instantaneous for any action such as searching words or switching between views.
